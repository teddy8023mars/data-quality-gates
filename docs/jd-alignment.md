# Data engineering JD alignment

Checked 2026-10-15. This is a portfolio capability comparison, not a hiring score, seniority claim or proof of meeting a role's experience minimum. The first releases were built around the Meta Analytics target and common engineering fundamentals; they were not previously an exhaustive current-market JD comparison.

## Employer sources

- [Amazon Data Engineer II, 10542497, Hyderabad](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/10542497/data-engineer-ii): modeling/warehousing/ETL, reporting integrity and validation, self-service analytics; AWS preferred. Minimum 3+ years DE and 4+ years SQL. Employer page read with application link visible.
- [Amazon Data Engineer — AI/ML Products, 10572912, Beijing](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/10572912/data-engineer-ai-ml-products-aop-analytics-operations-and-programs): pipelines and analytics/ML data infrastructure, warehouses/lakes, governance/security, CI/CD and collaboration; cloud knowledge and 3+ years DE. Employer page read.
- [Grab Senior Data Engineer, 744000153988681, Jakarta](https://www.grab.careers/en/jobs/744000153988681/senior-data-engineer/): batch/event-driven pipelines, reliable metrics, data checks, AWS and Flink/Spark/Kafka/Airflow/Trino; 6+ years. Used to identify advanced stack gaps, not to suggest this senior vacancy is the user's present match.
- [Meta Singapore Data Engineer, Analytics, LinkedIn job4466993038](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4466993038/): primary preparation target, using the previously researched JD snapshot. Current availability not reverified in this audit; do not call it a newly confirmed live vacancy.

These examples span APAC but are not all Singapore jobs. Listings change; application eligibility and availability must be checked again before applying.

## Capability-to-evidence matrix

| JD capability | Current concrete evidence | Present limit | Next improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Python/SQL modeling, analytics | MOBA typed events → deduplicated staging → user-day/player-match facts → cohort/hero/payment marts; executed optional dbt graph with 13 models, three singular data tests, two-cutoff parity and deliberately failing retention test | DuckDB local full rebuild; tiny showcase and separate regular synthetic benchmark, not production distribution | dbt and declared-scale benchmark (2,150/21,500/107,500 raw rows, three fresh processes each) complete; stage profiling locates raw loading at about 99% of local wall time; bounded parameter batching now shows about 29% less local elapsed time at 107,500 regular synthetic records with complete output parity; local Airflow dependency/retry execution also verified; next: reproducible end-to-end walkthrough and remaining deployment-gap review |
| ETL and data correctness | Versioned inserts/updates/deletes; target/checkpoint coupled in SQLite transaction; independent reconciliation; actual owned-worker SIGKILL and reopen tested | Synthetic source envelopes, no production connector/broker or distributed guarantee | POSIX process-kill/reopen experiment now verified in incremental-load-lab; next: bounded integration example |
| Data checks, integrity, validation | Eight declarative CSV check types; strict retention contract checks integral counts and exact bounded ratio consistency, in addition to retained/cohort bounds; real clean/dirty CLI gates | Memory-based local files; no service or warehouse connector | Strict count/rate arithmetic now verified; cohort maturity still owned by producer; next: fresh-install end-to-end walkthrough and contract limits |
| Reporting, self-service consumption | HTML/CSV exports; interactive pages explain retention eligibility, failure recovery and violations | Recorded synthetic results; not deployed BI or backend service | Clickable dashboards linked from README; evidence and metric definitions beside visuals |
| CI/CD and version control | Actual GitHub CI on Python3.11/3.12, packaged CLI installation where configured | Checks/test pipeline; not cloud deployment infrastructure | Reproducible deployment/build jobs with transparent status |
| Airflow/orchestration | Executed local Airflow 2.11 TaskFlow DAG.test with synthetic generation/build/validation/local manifest; native retry and failed-gate downstream blocking | Serialized local execution only; no scheduler/executor service deployment, scheduled backfill or distributed artifact design | Local dependency/retry example complete; operational deployment remains a separate gap |
| AWS/data lake/security | No project evidence yet | No S3/Redshift/Glue/IAM infrastructure, no cloud deployment or governance service | Design reproducible optional cloud/infrastructure exercise; no paid resources without authorization |
| Spark/Kafka/Flink/distributed scale | No project evidence yet | Cannot infer from Python/DuckDB/SQLite tests | Pick one justified distributed scenario; do not add decorative stack names |
| Stakeholder impact/experience years | Professional employment, separately documented | Personal demos do not create employer impact or additional years | User walkthrough and honest personal-project resume bullets |

## Visual acceptance

Recruiter can understand each repository within one screen: project problem, actual result preview, live demo button, source/run entry. Visualizations use reproducible exported JSON, disclose synthetic data and recorded reference times, keep not-observable retention cells distinct from zero, retain tombstones in recovery snapshots, and do not sum overlapping violations into bad-row counts. Pages contain no paid dependency or company data. Visuals communicate the implementation rather than substitute for it.
